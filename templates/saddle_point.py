def saddle_point(I):
    """
    Locate saddle point in an image patch.

    The function identifies the subpixel centre of a cross-junction in the
    image patch I, by fitting a hyperbolic paraboloid to the patch, and then 
    finding the critical point of that paraboloid.

    Note that the location of 'pt' is relative to (-0.5, -0.5) at the upper
    left corner of the patch, i.e., the pixels are treated as covering an 
    area of one unit square.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    I  - Single-band (greyscale) image patch as np.array (e.g., uint8, float).

    Returns:
    --------
    pt  - 2x1 np.array (float64), subpixel location of saddle point in I (x, y).
